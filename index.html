      <div class="tags">node.js javascript memcache client</div>
      <p>A straightforward, correct, performant client for memcached written in javascript for the node.js platform.</p>
      <p>Design philosophy: the application developer will want to have control over sharding
         strategies. The application developer will want to have control over any particular details of
         storage. The application developer will want a dead simple interface for accessing memcache.
         There are common use cases for many applications that the client can satisfy out of the box.</p>
      <p>Notable use cases: storage of binary values supported.</p>
      <p>"Make the easy stuff trivial, and the hard stuff easy."</p>

      <div class="tags">node.js javascript connection pool persistent manager</div>
      <p>A simple tool to reduce boilerplate in handling connection management for long-lived
         persistent connections.</p>
      <p>Intended use: you have an application that opens a socket connection and reads and writes over that
         connection for the life of your applications -- or for a large number of reads and writes. If you
         drop that connection, you want to re-establish it. You do not want anything impeding your performance,
         and you don't need an additional level of abstraction. If this sounds like you, you will probably 
         enjoy this tool.</p>
